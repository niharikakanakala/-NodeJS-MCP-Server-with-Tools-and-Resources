🛡️ **What is MCP?**

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI applications to interact with external tools and data sources. This server enables:

🤖 AI Integration: Direct integration with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI models

🔧 Tool Execution: AI can perform calculations and data operations

📊 Data Access: AI can query and analyze your data

🔄 Context Preservation: Maintain state across AI interactions

**🌟 Features**

**🛠️ Tools (Executable Functions)**

    Calculator Tool: Perform mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
    Data Retrieval Tool: Get specific records by ID and type
    Data Creation Tool: Create new users, products, and orders
    Advanced Validation: Input validation for all tool operations

**📁 Resources (Data Access)**

    Users Resource: Access user data collection
    Products Resource: Access product catalog
    Orders Resource: Access order history
    Settings Resource: Server configuration and system settings

**💾 Data Management**

      In-Memory Data Store: Fast, efficient data storage using Maps
      CRUD Operations: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
      Search Capabilities: Query data across all collections
      Statistics Generation: Real-time data analytics and metrics
  
**🏗️ Architecture**

**MCP Server Components:**

    🏭 Factory Pattern → Server Creation & Configuration
    🔧 Tools Handler → Executable Functions (calculate, get_data, create_data)
    📂 Resources Handler → Data Access (users, products, orders, settings)
    💾 Data Service → CRUD Operations & In-Memory Storage
    ✅ Validation Utilities → Input Validation & Error Handling
    🧪 Test Suite → Comprehensive Testing Coverage
